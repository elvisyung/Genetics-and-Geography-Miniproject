# Genes-and-Geograph-MiniProject
Mini-project bioinformatic project applying PCA on vcf files obtained through the international genome sample resource site. Furthermore, obtained population data to better visualise genes and geography. Principles Applied: PCA, tSNE, and matrices. 

Project was inspired by a Nature published article on understanding the genetic structure of human population by running PCA on genetic disease and geography data. Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07331
